  # water cover is currently a charcater string, converting to numeric
  mutate(Water_cover = as.numeric(Water_cover)) %>%

# cleaning land_cover column
snowsurvey_clean <- snowsurvey_clean %>% 
  mutate(Land_cover = as.numeric(Land_cover)) %>% 
  filter(Land_cover >= 0) %>% 
  mutate(Total_cover = as.numeric(Total_cover))
# There are values of total cover that do not equal 100, starting at 0 to 15 to 95. I will remove any columns in which the totalcov is less than 100

snowsurvey_clean <- snowsurvey_clean %>% 
  filter(Total_cover == 100)



## Assumptions:
# The first assumption I made was that the columns both contained periods and dashes after looking at the water_cover column only. The second assumption I made was that any observation in which the total_cover was not equal to zero was not measured properly or the formula was not a valid observation. 


## Decisions:
# After inspecting the Water_Cover column, I chose to filter out any observations in which Water_Cover was greater than 100. After inspecting the Land_Cover column, I chose to filter out any values less than 0 as negative values are incorrect to have. I also chose to filter out any values in the Total_cover column that did not equal 100, and the number of rows removed was a small percentage of the original dataset.
